1. Feature Importance via Sensitivity Analysis (FHE-compatible)
You can measure feature importance under FHE with simplified techniques:
For each feature:
Homomorphically perturb the encrypted input (e.g., zero it or add a constant).
Compute the change in encrypted output.
Larger changes = higher feature importance.

# Pseudocode-like sketch
for i in range(num_features):
    x_test_mod = x_test_encrypted.copy()
    x_test_mod[i] += delta  # or set to 0
    y_pred_mod = fhe_model.predict(x_test_mod)
    importance[i] = decrypt(y_pred_mod - y_pred_original)

Pros:
- Fully homomorphic.
- Linear operations only.
- Easy to parallelize.
